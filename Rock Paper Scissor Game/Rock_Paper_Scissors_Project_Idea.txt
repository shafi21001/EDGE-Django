Project Idea: Rock-Paper-Scissors GUI Game

1. Overview:
   - Develop a graphical version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python.
   - Implement an interactive and user-friendly GUI with score tracking.

2. Objectives:
   - Learn and apply Python's tkinter library for GUI programming.
   - Incorporate basic game logic and randomness for gameplay.
   - Build a fun and engaging project that demonstrates programming skills.

3. Features:
   - GUI with buttons for user input (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
   - Randomized computer choice for the game.
   - Dynamic result display (Win, Lose, Draw).
   - Real-time score tracking and display.

4. Technologies Used:
   - Programming Language: Python
   - Libraries: tkinter, random

5. Key Components:
   - Gameplay logic handled via a function that processes user and computer choices.
   - GUI elements (buttons, labels) for interaction and feedback.
   - Random module for generating the computer's choice.

6. Future Enhancements:
   - Extend the game to include additional moves (e.g., Lizard, Spock).
   - Add sound effects or animations for a richer user experience.
   - Implement a multiplayer mode with score tracking for both players.

7. Why This Project?
   - Beginner-friendly, suitable for learning Python and GUI programming.
   - Small yet impactful, showcasing coding and design skills.
   - Fun to create and play, making it engaging for users and developers alike.
